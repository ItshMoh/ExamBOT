What are the different types of comments in Rust?
Rust supports a few different varieties of comments: Regular comments which are ignored by the compiler: // Line comments which go to the end of the line. /* Block comments which go to the closing delimiter. */ Doc comments which are parsed into HTML library documentation: /// Generate library docs for the following item. //! Generate library docs for the enclosing item.

What are the different macros for printing in Rust?
Printing is handled by a series of macros defined in std::fmt some of which include: format!: write formatted text to String print!: same as format! but the text is printed to the console (io::stdout). println!: same as print! but a newline is appended. eprint!: same as print! but the text is printed to the standard error (io::stderr). eprintln!: same as eprint! but a newline is appended.

In line 43, #[allow(dead_code)] is an attribute which only applies to the module after it.

What is the difference between fmt::Debug and fmt::Display in Rust?
fmt::Debug makes all types printable in a straightforward manner and can be derived for all types. fmt::Display, which must be manually implemented, is used for more elegant, user-friendly output.

What is the derive attribute in Rust?
The derive attribute in Rust automatically creates the necessary implementation to make a struct printable with fmt::Debug.

What is the purpose of the fmt::Display trait in Rust?
fmt::Display trait in Rust is used for customizing the output appearance. It uses the {} print marker and must be manually implemented for each type.

Why is fmt::Display not implemented for Vec<T> in Rust?
fmt::Display is not implemented for Vec<T> or for any other generic containers in Rust because there is no ideal style for all types and the std library doesn't presume to dictate one. For these generic cases, fmt::Debug must be used.

An array in Rust is a collection of objects of the same type T, stored in contiguous memory. Arrays are created using brackets [], and their length, which is known at compile time, is part of their type signature [T; length].

What is a slice in Rust?
A slice in Rust is similar to an array, but their length is not known at compile time. Instead, a slice is a two-word object; the first word is a pointer to the data, the second word is the length of the slice. Slices can be used to borrow a section of an array and have the type signature &[T].

In Rust, you can declare a variable using the let keyword followed by the name of the variable and its value. For example: let x = 5.

What is the difference between mutable and immutable variables in Rust?
In Rust, variables are immutable by default, meaning their value cannot be changed once they are bound. To make a variable mutable, you can use the mut keyword. For example: let mut x = 5.

What is the shadowing feature in Rust?
Shadowing in Rust allows you to declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable, effectively creating a new variable that shadows the previous one. This is done using the let keyword.

What are the different data types in Rust?
Rust has several data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, characters, tuples, arrays, and slices.

What is the difference between a tuple and an array in Rust?
In Rust, a tuple is a collection of values of different types, while an array is a collection of values of the same type. The size of a tuple is known at compile time, while the size of an array can be dynamic.

How can you access elements in a tuple or an array in Rust?
In Rust, you can access elements in a tuple using a period (.) followed by the index of the value, and elements in an array using brackets [] with the index of the value inside.

What is the panic! macro in Rust?
The panic! macro in Rust is used to generate an error and stop the program when the code encounters a situation it doesn't know how to handle.

What is the difference between signed and unsigned integers in Rust?
In Rust, signed integers can store both positive and negative numbers, while unsigned integers can only store positive numbers. The 'i' in types like i8, i32, etc. stands for signed, and the 'u' in types like u8, u32, etc. stands for unsigned.

What is the difference between isize and usize in Rust?
isize and usize in Rust are types of integers that are used when indexing collections. The size of these types is determined by the architecture of the machine the program is running on: 64 bits on a 64-bit machine and 32 bits on a 32-bit machine.

What is a tuple struct in Rust?
A tuple struct in Rust is a struct where the fields do not have names, but they have types. Tuple structs are defined using the struct keyword, followed by the name of the struct, and then the types of the fields in parentheses. For example: struct Pair(i32, f32);

What is a classic C struct in Rust?
A classic C struct in Rust is a struct where the fields have names and types. It is defined using the struct keyword, followed by the name of the struct, and then the fields in curly braces. Each field has a name and a type, separated by a colon. For example: struct Point { x: f32, y: f32, };

How can structs be used in Rust?

The inspect function takes a 'WebEvent' enum as an argument and uses a match statement to perform different actions based on the variant of 'WebEvent'.

What are type aliases in Rust?
In Rust, if you use a type alias, you can refer to each enum variant via its alias. This might be useful if the enum's name is too long or too generic, and you want to rename it.

What are the two types of constants in Rust?
Rust has two different types of constants which can be declared in any scope including global. These are 'const', an unchangeable value, and 'static', a possibly mutable variable with 'static lifetime.

What is a const in Rust?
In Rust, a 'const' is an unchangeable value. It requires explicit type annotation.

What is a static in Rust?
In Rust, a 'static' is a possibly mutable variable with 'static lifetime. The static lifetime is inferred and does not have to be specified. Accessing or modifying a mutable static variable is unsafe.

What does Rust provide via static typing?
Rust provides type safety via static typing. Variable bindings can be type annotated when declared. However, in most cases, the compiler will be able to infer the type of the variable from the context, heavily reducing the annotation burden.

How does Rust handle conversion between custom types?
Rust addresses conversion between custom types (i.e., struct and enum) by the use of traits. The generic conversions will use the From and Into traits.

To convert any type to a String in Rust is as simple as implementing the ToString trait for the type. Rather than doing so directly, you should implement the fmt::Display trait which automagically provides ToString and also allows printing the type.

How to parse a String in Rust?
In Rust, it's useful to convert strings into many types, but one of the more common string operations is to convert them from string to number. The idiomatic approach to this is to use the parse function and either to arrange for type inference or to specify the type to parse using the 'turbofish' syntax.
