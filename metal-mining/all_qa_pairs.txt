Q:  If miners are working "Overhand," what direction are they progressing?
A:  When miners are working "Overhand," they are advancing in an upward direction.

Q: What type of mining progression is described by the term "Underhand"?
A: "Underhand" describes mining progression in a downward direction.


Q: What is the primary function of a cross-cut in underground mining?
A: A cross-cut connects various tunnels or workings within a mine, serving as essential routes for accessing ore bodies, ventilation, and transportation.

Q: How do cross-cuts facilitate access to ore bodies?
A: Cross-cuts are driven from a main drift or tunnel, cutting through the rock horizontally or slightly inclined to intersect and provide access to the ore vein or body.

Q: What role do cross-cuts play in mine ventilation?
A: By connecting different parts of the mine, cross-cuts allow air to circulate, improving ventilation, especially in deeper and more remote areas.

Q: How are cross-cuts utilized for transportation in underground mines?
A: Cross-cuts establish transportation routes for the movement of ore, waste, materials, miners, machinery, and supplies between different sections of the underground mine workings.

Q: In what type of mining operation are cross-cuts typically used?
A: Cross-cuts are typically used in underground mining operations.


Q: What is a lateral in the context of excavation?
A: A lateral is a secondary or tertiary horizontal opening, often parallel or at an angle to a haulageway, primarily used for ventilation or other auxiliary services.

Q: How is a level defined in mine excavation?
A: A level is a system of interconnected horizontal openings connected to a shaft, forming the operating horizon of a mine.

Q: What is the function of a loading pocket in a mine shaft?
A: A loading pocket serves as a transfer point at a shaft where bulk material is loaded into a skip using bins, hoppers, and chutes.

Q: Describe a longwall in terms of its dimensions and typical location.
A: A longwall is a horizontal exploitation opening extending several hundred feet (meters) in length, commonly found in tabular deposits.

Q: What is the purpose of a manway in a mine?
A: A manway is a compartment within a raise or vertical/near-vertical opening designed for the safe passage of personnel between different levels of the mine.


Q: What is a stope in mining terminology?
A: A stope is the broken, caved, and mined-out portion of a mineral deposit.

Q: What is the function of a pillar in underground mining?
A: A pillar is an unmined portion of the deposit that provides support to the roof or hanging wall of an excavation.

Q: How is a crown pillar defined in relation to an excavation?
A: A crown pillar is a portion of the deposit that overlies an excavation and is left in place to provide support.

Q: What is a sill pillar, and where is it located?
A: A sill pillar is a portion of the deposit that underlies an excavation and is left in place as a support structure.

Q: What is a rib in the context of mining excavations?
A: A rib is the side wall of an excavation; it can also refer to a rib pillar, a pillar supporting the side wall.


Q: What is the defining characteristic that distinguishes an adit from a tunnel?
A: An adit has a single access point to the surface, while a tunnel has access points at both ends.

Q:  How are declines and inclines similar, and how do they differ?
A: Both declines and inclines are secondary inclined openings used to connect levels within an excavation.  Declines are driven downward, while inclines are driven upward.

Q: What is a drift in the context of underground excavation?
A: A drift is a horizontal or near-horizontal opening (primary or secondary) that runs parallel to the strike of a sloping deposit.

Q: What is the purpose of an entry in underground mining?
A: Entries are secondary horizontal or near-horizontal openings, often created in multiples, to access different parts of an underground excavation.

Q: What is a portal in relation to underground excavations?
A: A portal is any opening or connection that provides access from an underground excavation to the surface.


Q: What is a key cost advantage of using adits for ore extraction?
A: Adits are cost-effective for extracting ore from shallow ore bodies.

Q: How can adits facilitate ore extraction?
A: Adits allow for direct extraction of ore that is close to the surface.

Q: What is an environmental advantage of using adits compared to deeper mines?
A: Adits often benefit from better natural ventilation than deeper mines.

Q: What is a major limitation of using adits for ore extraction?
A: Adits are only suitable for shallow ore bodies; their depth of penetration is limited.

Q:  What type of ore bodies are adits best suited for?
A: Adits are best suited for shallow ore bodies, those exposed or close to the surface.


Q: What is a crosscut in the context of excavation?
A: A crosscut is a tertiary horizontal opening that often connects drifts, entries, or rooms. It's oriented perpendicularly to the strike of a deposit and can also serve as a breakthrough.

Q: What is the primary purpose of a haulageway?
A: A haulageway is a horizontal opening used mainly for materials handling.

Q: How does a bell function in an excavation?
A: A bell is a funnel-shaped excavation at the top of a raise.  It uses gravity to move bulk material from a stope to a drawpoint.

Q: What is the role of a bleeder in excavation?
A: A bleeder serves as an exhaust ventilation lateral.

Q: What is a finger raise and how does it work?
A: A finger raise is a vertical or near-vertical opening used to transfer bulk material from a stope to a drawpoint.  Often, finger raises are interconnected.
